# Profesional Portfolio Site


## Finished Product Summary

I was wanting to build a site where I would be able to present my skillsets from past projects that I have completed.  These past projects are presented with a clickable image that would deploy to the specified work.  I also wanted to be able to  have my contact information readily available for future employers so that they would be able to contact me.  While doing this I realized new concepts in design and layout formatting.

The following is a link to the website.
